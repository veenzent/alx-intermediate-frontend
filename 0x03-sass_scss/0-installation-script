STEPS TO INSTALL SASS
- Install Node.js if not already installed. If you already have Node.js installed (like me), you can skip this step.

Linux installation (Optional)
In your ubuntu terminal install node version 20.16 as follows
`$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash`
_Exit the terminal using the exit command then reopen it._


- SASSInstallation Anywhere (Optional)

Install SASS by using the following command if you have node installed.
`npm install sass -v 3.7.4`
